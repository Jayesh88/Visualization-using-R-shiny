## Electricity consumption analysis:

I have calculated energy consumption for the monthby focusing on the four metrics:
1. Average demand
2. Average demand per square foot
3. Total demand
4. Peak demand

Also used ggplot library to visualize all the factories on the basis of per square feet for which i used a bar graph. Then used line and point to shown which day of the month had the highest demand which can be seen in below figure.

## Hotel Booking Demand:

For this i computed some of the most important stats that the hotel might analyse like:
1. Total people stayed
2. Total Weekend nights spent
3. Total cancellation made
4. Total countries guests visited from

Then used Box-plot to visualize the average daily rate for each of the rooms that the guests stayed in. Also used line chart for two city and resort hotel to visualize that which quarter in the last 3 years data had maximum number of bookings which can be seen in the below figure.
